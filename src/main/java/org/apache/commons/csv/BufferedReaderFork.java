/**
 * Wraps an existing {@link Reader} and <em>buffers</em> the input. Expensive
 * interaction with the underlying reader is minimized, since most (smaller)
 * requests can be satisfied by accessing the buffer alone. The drawback is that
 * some extra space is required to hold the buffer and that copying takes place
 * when filling that buffer, but this is usually outweighed by the performance
 * benefits.
 * 
 * <p/>A typical application pattern for the class looks like this:<p/>
 *
 * <pre>
 * 
 * BufferedReader buf = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(&quot;file.java&quot;));
 * </pre>
 *
 * Modifications:
 * Adapted this class from Apache Harmony project.
 * All synchronized blocks are removed from the BufferedReader in order to reach a better performance since in Java 15 the synchronisation optimization is deprecated and in Java 18 the optimization is removed.
 * 
 * @see BufferedWriter
